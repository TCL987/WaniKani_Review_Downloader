==========================

To configured the script open it in a text editor and replace the value for 
API_KEY and LEVELS (replace the stuff between the quotes only) the format for level string is just 
comma separated level numbers without any spaces.

Example:
API_KEY = "c6848ce10af685661dbec5ff67bb42be"
LEVELS = "1,2"
